This project aims to build a modern cluster pipeline tools for Bioinformatists with a foucus on Cancer DNA analysis pipeline.

### Features
- light weight
- easy to learn and easy to hack
- built with Julia but can be used for other languages via a C API

### Highlights
- Fast
  - Hierachy of memories: in memory rather disk IO
  - Pipelining: tasks
  - Parallelism: stream processing
  - Prediction: automatically tune the number of workers and threads
- light weight

### Architecture
- Data
- computing
